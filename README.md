# BÃ©zier Curve
### **Abstract**:
A BÃ©zier curve is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields. A set of discrete "control points" defines a smooth, continuous curve by means of a formula. Usually the curve is intended to approximate a real-world shape that otherwise has no mathematical representation or whose representation is unknown or too complicated. BÃ©zier curve is named after French engineer Pierre BÃ©zier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars. Other uses include the design of computer fonts and animation. BÃ©zier curves can be combined to form a BÃ©zier spline, or generalized to higher dimensions to form BÃ©zier surfaces. The BÃ©zier triangle is a special case of the latter.
